# SKILL.md review Guide Line 

## Instructions
 - Progressive disclosure
 - Skills should be structured for efficient use of context:
 - Metadata (~100 tokens): The name and description fields are loaded at startup for all skills
 - Instructions (< 5000 tokens recommended): The full SKILL.md body is loaded when the skill is activated
 - Resources (as needed): Files (e.g. those in scripts/, references/, or assets/) are loaded only when required
 - Keep your main SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.


## Result
If pass give me a "tick", if not give me a "cross"
